# Iteration 1 Retrospective

## Completion Status
In the first iteration, we completed five user stories: User Story 1 (Collecting User Location Information), 2 (Smart Chat with Switchable Human-Computer Mode), 4 (Service Booking System), 6 (Conversation History), and 7 (In-App Payment). We connected the conversation history to the database and received feedback. However, when we reported our work to our instructor, she suggested that we also store booking information in the database. We subsequently implemented this improvement.

## What went well
During this sprint, our team communication and division of labor were excellent. Every member actively participated in group discussions and worked collaboratively. In addition to collaborating in class, we also proactively helped each other with homework after class, further strengthening team cohesion. Through effective collaboration, we successfully completed the first iteration within the allotted timeframe and achieved our on-time delivery goal.

## What did not go well
However, regarding backend development, we realized there were still areas for improvement. For example, we initially did not store booking information in the database, a practice that was highlighted as a limitation during the review. Furthermore, we received recommendations to prioritize the development of the registration and login pages to ensure the completeness of the user flow.

## What can be improved for the next iteration
Through this Sprint, we realized the importance of sound system architecture planning for subsequent development. We also realized that prioritizing feature development early in the project, especially for core features (such as login, registration, and database integration), can effectively avoid rework later. Furthermore, we learned from our mentor's feedback how to better assess the need for user data storage and improve the system's data integrity and usability. 
In the next iteration, we plan to prioritize completing user registration and login features to ensure smooth user access to key services. We will also further refine our database design to ensure secure and reliable storage of service reservation and payment information. Furthermore, we will develop a detailed feature development plan in advance to avoid missing critical modules.
