# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1
# Project overview
"MyClean" is a reservation and management platform for the cleaning service industry, which aims to connect users who need cleaning services with individual cleaners or cleaning companies and change the way cleaning services are booked and managed. The application will provide users with convenient online reservation, service rating and order management functions, while providing service providers with tools such as scheduling, customer management, and payment tracking. The platform is free for end users, and the source of income includes subscription fees from service providers or other profit strategies, such as featured listings or usage-based packages. The project is developed using modern technologies and cloud services (such as AWS), with the goal of completing a minimum viable product (MVP) with core functions within two iteration cycles to achieve an efficient and intelligent cleaning service experience.

# Goals
Project Purpose:
Develop a modern, user-friendly website that connects users who need cleaning services with individuals or companies that provide cleaning services.

Project Goals:
1. Provide users with fast and convenient cleaning service booking capabilities.

2. Provide scheduling, customer management and revenue tracking tools for cleaners and cleaning companies.
